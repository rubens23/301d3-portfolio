      <h1>Kobe's Last Game</h1>
      <p>One of the most amazing feats in recent sports history occurred on April 13th, 2016 when Kobe Bryant played in his final
        NBA game against the Utah Jazz. Many regard Kobe as arguably one of the greatest players in NBA history. A 17-time All-Star,
        11-time All-NBA selections, five world championships and an MVP award coming his way in the year 2008. The accolades could go
        on and on but you get the point. </p><p><img src="img/kobe1.jpg" class="pull-right"> Throughout the entire season the Lakers
          were horrible and Kobe was the worst shooter in the entire league by percentage. Some say his subpar play was due to the amount
          of years he has played basketball and the wear and tear on his body. Others look to his old age and believe
          that the amount of injuries he\'s sustained in the past few years are to blame. Whatever the case may be the
          box office attraction that was once Kobe Bryant did not diminish, in fact, it increased exponentially. Stadiums around the country
          were sold out any time the Lakers came to town so that fans could get one last look at The Mamba. For most of his career, Kobe had
          been hated anywhere besides Los Angeles (naturally). But the hate directed towards this man seemed to come out of jealousy, anger,
          frustration and most importantly, respect. Fans all over the country despised Kobe when he came to play against their teams because he
          was just that good. They hoped and hoped that their own star players would someday become good enough to be able to challenge
          his greatness and be able to beat him. Rarely has that worked, especially in playoff contests. They hated, but respected him because
          the amount of time and energy he put in to strengthen his game and become the best player he could possibly be is unparalelled.
          <br><br> Throughout this past season however, Kobe got way more cheers than jeers. Since he announcd is retirement early in the season
          fans began clamoring for tickets in order to get one last look at the Mamba. The feel in most of the away stadiums seemed confusing for a while.
          Fans didn\'t seem to know what they wanted to see most: their team win, or Kobe go off for 30 or 40 points? On some nights they got to see a Kobe
          show but their team would beat the Lakers, which was ideal. But Kobe spent most of the first half of the season shooting bricks.
          His legs were not under him, and his body was not used to the high level of play that an NBA game requires after missing almost two full seasons.
          He started coming into his own midway through the season with a group of young players around him leading the show. But when Kobe had a chance, he still
          showed flashes of his old self that people had become accustomed to throughout the years. <br><br> Fast forward to last Wednesday
          night, and Kobe put on a masterpiece. He scored 60 Points for the sixth time in his career. Yes you read that right, SIXTY POINTS.
          Many sports analysts guessed Kobe would go out and score about 30 to 40 points due to the amount of shots he would take. But
          they never saw this coming. It was a performance for the ages. He had 22 points by halftime and scored 23 points in the 4th quarter
          alone to lead a 10 point Laker comeback in the final two minutes of the game. Kobe looked like Kobe. Hitting fadeaway jumpshots,
          three pointers, and a go-ahead jumper in the last minute of the game to put the Lakers ahead for good. After the ensuing Jazz miss,
          Kobe was sent to the foul line for the last time in his career sitting on 58 points. He made his first and second free-throws to give
          him the big 6-0. He then exited the game and addressed the crowd afterwards in an amazing post-game speech with the final words
          being "Mamba Out". He was already legendary before this game, but now he has erased the memory of him struggling for most of this past season
          and playing like the Kobe that we know and love. </p>
